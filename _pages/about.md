I am a PhD candidate in [Applied Physics](https://aph.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, advised by Prof. [Oskar Painter](https://copilot.caltech.edu/people/principal). My current research lies at the intersection of engineering and quantum physics, towards the advancement of quantum processors for practical applications and fundamental studies. Specifically, I utilize microwave photons in engineered waveguides as messengers between superconducting qubits (waveguide QED), in order to achieve long-range qubit-qubit coupling with various spatial profiles. With recent progress, I can employ multi-qubit quantum processors towards quantum simulation of many-body physics.

Prior to my PhD, my research focus was on micro- and nano-photonic devices, studying both the underlying physics, and their applications. I was fortunate to collaborate with many great mentors both in the US and in China.
