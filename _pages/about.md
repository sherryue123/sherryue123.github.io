I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Applied Physics](https://aph.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, advised by Prof. [Oskar Painter](https://copilot.caltech.edu/people/principal). My current research lies at the intersection of engineering and quantum physics, towards advancing quantum processors for both practical applications and fundamental studies. Specifically, I utilize microwave photons in engineered waveguides as messengers between superconducting qubits (waveguide QED) to achieve long-range qubit-qubit coupling with various spatial profiles. With our recent progress, I can employ multi-qubit quantum processors for quantum simulation of many-body physics.

Before graduate school, I focused on micro- and nano-photonic devices, studying both the underlying physics and their applications. I was fortunate to collaborate with many great advisors around the globe.
