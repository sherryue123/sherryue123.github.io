I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Applied Physics](https://aph.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, advised by Prof. [Oskar Painter](https://copilot.caltech.edu/people/principal). My current research lies at the intersection of engineering and quantum physics, towards advancing quantum processors for both practical applications and fundamental studies. Specifically, I utilize microwave photons in engineered waveguides as messengers between superconducting qubits (waveguide QED) to achieve long-range qubit-qubit coupling with various spatial profiles. With our recent progress, I can employ multi-qubit quantum processors for quantum simulation of many-body physics.

Before graduate school, I focused on micro- and nano-photonic devices, studying both the underlying physics and their applications. I was fortunate to collaborate with many great advisors around the globe.

## News and upcoming activities
* I'm giving an invited (outreach) talk at the [FUTURE of Physics 2022](https://future.pma.caltech.edu/) on September 12th at Caltech. Looking forward to meeting the new generation of women in physics! 
* I'm giving an invited talk at Stanford University titled "A scalable superconducting quantum architecture with long-range connectivity" on September 16th. You can also tune in to the seminar via zoom. Let me know if you need the link.
* Our manuscript ''A scalable superconducting quantum simulator with long-range connectivity based on a photonic bandgap metamaterial'' is now on arXiv. Please check it out at [arXiv: 2206.12803](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12803).
