**My [group website](http://zhang.apam.columbia.edu) at Columbia University is now live! We are always looking for motivated and creative individuals at all levels. Please visit for the latest updates and information!**

I am a Miller Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley, working with [Alp Sipahigil](https://quantumdevices.berkeley.edu/team/). I received my Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Caltech in 2023 and B.Eng. from Tsinghua University in 2017. 

I will be starting my own group at Columbia University in January 2025. I am very excited about contributing to the frontier of quantum science and technology in this new role! Feel free to reach out to me if you are also interested in this field.

I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of quantum technology and unlocking its potential for solving complex problems in information processing and fundamental sciences. My research focuses on developing cutting-edge quantum hardware to overcome the limitations of existing solid-state quantum platforms and explore uncharted territories in physics research. Having previously introduced long-range connectivity to superconducting circuit architectures, I am now a Miller Fellow, investigating innovative telecom-band quantum emitters in the mature silicon host material. Combining my background in micro- and nano-photonic devices, I am interested in creating robust, scalable quantum processors that can simulate many-body physics and drive advancements in both practical applications and theoretical understanding. 

I have been fortunate to have collaborated with outstanding mentors/colleagues from around the world, including [Oskar Painter](https://painterlab.caltech.edu/faculty/), [Soonwon Choi](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/soonwon-choi/), [Alejandro Gonz√°lez-Tudela](https://sites.google.com/view/gonzaleztudela), [Kerry Vahala](https://vahala.caltech.edu/people), [Yun-Feng Xiao](http://researchgroups.pku.edu.cn/microcavity/en/zdylm/12811/list/index.htm), and [Wenshan Cai](https://cailab.gatech.edu/group.html).
