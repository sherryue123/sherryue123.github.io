In the process of developing techniques to induce photons to behave as though they live in a magnetic field, we discovered that we could make them behave as though they are near a singularity of spatial curvature, akin to a black hole; this interplay of curvature and momentum-space topology is an extremely active area of research, and is uniquely accessible in our experiments."],
